## 4. Enhanced Performance Metrics & Management System Analytics

### 4.1 Cost Per Kilometer (CPK) Calculation Framework

**Management System Platform Clarification:**
As a **management system platform**, the CPK calculation uses configurable cost parameters that businesses can customize based on their operational structure. Since this is a management tool (not a company owning drivers/vehicles), the cost components are configurable examples that client businesses adapt to their actual costs.

#### **Configurable Cost Components:**
- **Distance Tracking**: Uses actual route optimization distances from client operations
- **Cost Configuration**: Example parameters (₹8.5/km fuel, ₹25 driver allocation, ₹2/km depreciation)
- **Business Customization**: Clients input their own operational cost structures
- **Real-time Calculation**: Dynamic updates based on actual trip parameters

#### **Cost Components Framework:**
```javascript
// Management System CPK Configuration Example
const configurableCPKParams = {
    fuelCostPerKm: 8.5, // Configurable by client business
    driverCostPerDelivery: 25, // Based on client's driver wage structure
    depreciationPerKm: 2, // Client's vehicle depreciation model
    operationalCosts: 15, // Tolls, parking, misc (client-specific)
};
```
