3. Observe console output during route optimization
4. Verify tasks are processed in correct priority order regardless of input order

Expected Console Output:
"Extracted task with deadline: 9:00 AM"   (Task D)
"Extracted task with deadline: 10:00 AM"  (Task A)  
"Extracted task with deadline: 11:30 AM"  (Task C)
"Extracted task with deadline: 2:00 PM"   (Task B)
```

## Test Case 4: Data Aggregation & Analytics Verification

**Objective:** Demonstrate sophisticated data aggregation capabilities and business intelligence metrics calculation.

**Grading Category:** Aggregation & Analytics

### Test Steps:

#### Step 4.1: Trip Log Data Generation
```
Setup: Create historical delivery data for metrics calculation
1. Complete 5 delivery tasks:
   - 3 completed on time (OTD = 60%)
   - 2 completed late
2. Generate trip logs with:
   - Distance data: 50km, 30km, 40km, 60km, 35km
   - Duration data: Various completion times
   - Cost data: Fuel and operational costs
```

#### Step 4.2: On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate Calculation Test
```
Verification Process:
1. Navigate to Performance Reports section
2. Observe OTD calculation in real-time
3. Verify calculation accuracy:
   
   Expected Calculation:
   OTD Rate = (3 on-time deliveries / 5 total deliveries) × 100 = 60%
   
4. Test edge cases:
   - Zero deliveries → OTD = 0%
   - All on-time → OTD = 100%  
   - Mixed scenarios → Correct percentage calculation
```

#### Step 4.3: Cost Per Kilometer (CPK) Aggregation Test
```
Test Scenario:
Trip Data:
- Trip 1: 50km, ₹500 operational cost
- Trip 2: 30km, ₹400 operational cost  
- Trip 3: 40km, ₹450 operational cost
- Trip 4: 60km, ₹600 operational cost
- Trip 5: 35km, ₹375 operational cost

Expected Calculation:
Total Cost = ₹2,325
Total Distance = 215km  
CPK = ₹2,325 ÷ 215km = ₹10.81 per km

Verification:
1. Check calculated CPK in dashboard
2. Verify accuracy of aggregation logic
3. Test with additional maintenance costs
4. Confirm correct unit conversions (meters to kilometers)
```

#### Step 4.4: Vehicle Utilization Rate (VUR) Calculation Test
```
Complex Aggregation Scenario:
Test Data:
- 2 vehicles active for 3 days
- Vehicle 1: 6 hours operating time per day
- Vehicle 2: 4 hours operating time per day
- Standard 8-hour work day

Expected Calculation:
Total Operating Time = (6 + 4) × 3 = 30 hours
Total Available Time = 2 vehicles × 3 days × 8 hours = 48 hours
VUR = (30 ÷ 48) × 100 = 62.5%

Verification Steps:
1. Create trip logs spanning multiple days
2. Assign trips to different vehicles
3. Verify unique vehicle identification in aggregation
4. Confirm correct time period calculation
5. Validate percentage accuracy in dashboard display
```

#### Step 4.5: Real-Time Analytics Update Test
```
Dynamic Aggregation Verification:
1. Record initial KPI values in dashboard
2. Complete additional delivery task (on-time)
3. Verify metrics update automatically:
   - OTD rate should increase
   - New trip data included in CPK calculation
   - VUR reflects additional operating time
4. Confirm real-time recalculation without page refresh
5. Test aggregation with multiple concurrent updates
```

#### Step 4.6: Historical Data Analysis Test
```
Time-Based Filtering Verification:
1. Use delivery history filter dropdown
2. Test different time periods:
   - Today: Shows only current day data
   - This Week: Aggregates 7-day period
   - This Month: Includes all monthly data
3. Verify correct data filtering in calculations
4. Confirm KPI accuracy for each time period
5. Test edge cases (no data for selected period)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Accurate mathematical calculations for all KPIs
- ✅ Real-time aggregation updates with new data
- ✅ Correct handling of complex multi-vehicle scenarios  
- ✅ Time-based filtering and historical analysis functional
