Project Completion Report
Project Title: Efficient Fleet Management & Route Optimization Platform
Document Version: Final
Completion Date: September 28, 2025

1. Executive Summary

This document confirms the successful completion of the Fleet Management & Route Optimization Platform project. The application has met all core requirements outlined in the PRD/SRD V8.0. The final product is a fully functional, real-time, pure JavaScript application that allows a dispatcher to manage a fleet of vehicles and a list of delivery tasks, optimize routes, and view performance analytics. Drivers can view their assigned routes and update task statuses. The system is built on a modern, serverless architecture using Firebase and is ready for end-to-end testing.

2. Key Features Implemented

The final application includes the following core functionalities:

Secure, Role-Based Authentication: Separate login and dashboard views for "Dispatcher" and "Driver" roles, secured by Firebase Authentication.

Live Fleet Map: A real-time Leaflet.js map that displays the live location of all vehicles, updating instantly as data changes in Firestore.

Fleet Management (Full CRUD): Dispatchers can now create, read, update, and delete vehicles/drivers directly from the dashboard UI, eliminating the need for manual database entry.

Task Management (Full CRUD): Dispatchers have full control to create, read, update, and delete delivery tasks.

Advanced Route Optimization:

DSA Prioritization: A custom Min-Heap correctly prioritizes tasks by deadline.

VRP Solver: The system intelligently calls the OpenRouteService Vroom API to solve the complex Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), respecting vehicle capacities and deadlines.

Driver Task Interaction: Drivers are presented with only their assigned tasks and can update the status of each task (e.g., "Mark Complete"), with changes reflected in real-time.

Performance Analytics: The dashboard calculates and displays the three core business KPIs (OTD Rate, CPK, and VUR) based on trip data.

3. Final Technical Stack

Component

Technology

Rationale

Frontend

Pure JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, Tailwind CSS

4. Acceptance Criteria Checklist

✓ Security: Both Dispatcher and Driver views require a successful login.

✓ Optimization: The system successfully calls the VRP API, and routes respect all constraints.

✓ Analytics: OTD, CPK, and VUR metrics are calculated correctly via client-side logic.

✓ CRUD: Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for tasks and fleet vehicles is operational for the dispatcher.
